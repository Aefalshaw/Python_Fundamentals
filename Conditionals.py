# CONDITIONALS

# Conditional Statements

# Allow us to run certain lines of code depending on whether certain conditions are met.
# These statements control the flow our code is executed by the interpreter.
# In Python, the keywords for conditional statements are if, elif, and else

x = 12
if x > 50:
    print("bigger than 50")
else:
    print("smaller than 50")
# because x is not greater than 50, the second print statement is the only one that will execute

x = 55
if x > 10:
    print("bigger than 10")
elif x > 50:
    print("bigger than 50")
else:
    print("smaller than 10")
# even though x is greater than 10 and 50, the first true statement is the only one that will execute, so we will only see 'bigger than 10'

if x < 10:
    print("smaller than 10")
# nothing happens, because the statement is false


# Comparison and Logic Operators

# ==	    Checks if the value of two operands are equal	                                                    1 == 2 => False                     1 == 1 => True
# !=	    Checks if the value of two operands are not equal	                                                    1 != 2 => True                      1 != 1 => False
# >	        Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand	                    1 > 2 => False                      2 > 1 => True
# <	        Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand	                      1 < 2 => True                       2 < 1 => False
# >=	    Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand	        1 >= 2 => False                     2 >= 2 => True
# <=	    Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand	            1 <= 2 => True                      2 <= 2 => True
# and	    Checks that each expression on the left and right are both True	                                    (1 <= 2) and (2 <= 3) => True       (1 <= 2) and (2 >= 3) => False
# or	    Checks if either the expression on the left or right is True	                                    (1 <= 2) or (2 >= 3) => True        (1 <= 2) or (2 <= 3) => True
# not	    Reverses the true-false value of the operand	                                                    not True => False                   not False => True
