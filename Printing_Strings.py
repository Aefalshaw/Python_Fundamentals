# PRINTING STRINGS

# String Literals: any sequence of characters (letters, numerals, ~($/}\#, etc.) enclosed in single or double quotes.

print("this is a sample string")

# Concatenating Strings and Variables with the print function

name = "Zen"
print("My name is", name)
print("My name is " + name)

# String Interpolation: injecting variables into strings

# F-Strings (Literal String Interpolation)

first_name = "Zen"
last_name = "Coder"
age = 27
print(f"My name is {first_name} {last_name} and I am {age} years old.")

# string.format()

first_name = "Zen"
last_name = "Coder"
age = 27
print("My name is {} {} and I am {} years old.".format(first_name, last_name, age))
# output: My name is Zen Coder and I am 27 years old.
print("My name is {} {} and I am {} years old.".format(age, first_name, last_name))
# output: My name is 27 Zen and I am Coder years old.

# %-formatting

hw = "Hello %s" % "world" 	# with literal values
py = "I love Python %d" % 3 
print(hw, py)
# output: Hello world I love Python 3
name = "Zen"
age = 27
print("My name is %s and I'm %d" % (name, age))		# or with variables
# output: My name is Zen and I'm 27

# Built-In String Methods

x = "hello world"
print(x.title())
# output:
"Hello World"

# string.upper(): returns a copy of the string with all the characters in uppercase.
# string.lower(): returns a copy of the string with all the characters in lowercase.
# string.count(substring): returns number of occurrences of substring in string.
# string.join(list): returns a string that is all strings within our set (in this case a list) concatenated.
# string.endswith(substring): returns a boolean based upon whether the last characters of string match substring.
# string.find(substring): returns the index of the start of the first occurrence of substring within string.
# string.split(char): returns a list of values where string is split at the given character. Without a parameter the default split is at every space.
# string.isalnum(): returns boolean depending on whether the string's length is > 0 and all characters are alphanumeric (letters and numbers only). Strings that include spaces and punctuation will return False for this method. Similar methods include .isalpha(), .isdigit(), .islower(), .isupper(), and so on. All return booleans.
